issue_title = "Real-time Coding Progress Monitor with Multi-Provider Dashboard"

issue_description = """
Build a comprehensive real-time monitoring dashboard that displays the coding progress of multiple providers working concurrently. Show what each provider is working on, files being modified, code being generated, and overall task completion status.

## Goals
- Provide real-time visibility into what each provider is doing
- Display file-level changes as they happen
- Show code generation progress with streaming updates
- Monitor resource usage (tokens, API calls, time)
- Alert on errors or blockers without stopping other providers

## Tasks
- Create interactive dashboard layout with provider status panels
- Implement real-time streaming updates via PubSub
- Add file operation tracking
- Create alert system for errors
- Implement navigation controls
- Add summary statistics

## Technical Context
- This is an Elixir/Phoenix application
- Already has: PubSub for real-time updates, Worker module for AI agents, Task allocation system (#12)
- Uses multiple AI providers concurrently (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Local)
- Current monitoring is basic - needs comprehensive dashboard
