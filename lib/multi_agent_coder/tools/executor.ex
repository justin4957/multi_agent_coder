  Executes commands in a sandboxed environment.

  This module handles the actual execution of tool requests, including:
  - Bash command execution
  - File operations (read, write, delete)
  - Git commands
  - Web searches (future)

  All commands are executed within a sandbox for security and resource isolation.

  ## Implementation Status: STUB

  This module is a stub for architecture planning. Implementation tracked in:
  - Issue #16.1: Core tool execution framework
  - Issue #16.2: Sandbox environment implementation
